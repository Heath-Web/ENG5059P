# attys-scope (Linux / Windows / MacOS)

Oscilloscope program for the Attys (http://www.attys.tech).

## Features

* Records from multiple Attys at the same time.
* Python plugins to visualise data or feed the data into your favourite game engine (via UDP broadcast).
* Saves data as tab separated values which can be directly imported into Python, MATLAB â„¢, OCTAVE, R, GNUPLOT and many other software packages.
* Change the gain, highpass, lowpass, 50/60Hz bandstop and rectifier for amplitude plots

The screenshot above shows attys-scope in action under Windows where it feeds the data into a Python program
which then plots a bar graph in realtime.

## Data format

For saving data to a file the format is either "comma separated" (CSV) or "tab separated" (TSV).

UDP packets are always transmitted as CSV.
