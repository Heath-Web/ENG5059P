# ECG artifacts removal with deep adaptive filter

An adaptive and real-time ECG filter Class with a deep neural network in C++, used to reduce ECG artifacts (EMG) from the ECG signals.

## Data Sets

The ECG signal were obtained from 2 subjects using AttysECG. For each subject, two set ups  were used which covers the noise from the bicep (arm) and the whole arm (wrist) separately.  Both of two subjects were holding a large bottle of water (weight 1.5 kg approximately) while recording. Each recording last one minute and a half.

Additional relaxed data was recorded from subject 1 while the subject keep relax.

## Prerequisites Libraries and packages:
1. Install the *Fir1* library from _https://github.com/berndporr/fir1_ by running:

   ` sudo add-apt-repository ppa:berndporr/dsp `

    `` sudo apt-get install fir1 ` 

   ` sudo apt-get install fir1-dev `

2. Install `Cmake`

   `wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.21.1/cmake-3.21.1.tar.gz`

   `tar -zxv -f cmake-3.21.1.tar.gz`

   `cd cmake-3.21.1`

   `./bootstrap`
   `make`

   `sudo make install`

   Alternatively,  install any `cmake` version beyond 3.1.0.

## How to compile and run the program (Demo):
1. Clone this repository: ` git clone https://github.com/Heath-Web/ENG5059P.git` 
2. Navigate to the folder: `cd ENG5059P`
3. compile the file using *cmake*: `cmake .` and `make`
4. run : `./ecg_filter_demo` 
   This will create the necessary folders, build the program and the DNF library. The program will filter all the data in `./Data/ProcessedData` and generate the output to `./Data/Output`. 
5. Show final results : 
   You can use either jupyter notebook `Plotresults.ipynb` or simply run the python file `Python PlotResults.py` in the PyScripts folder to plot the final results both in frequency domain and in dynamic time domain.

## How to use ecg_filter class

1. Make sure you have the *fircoefficient.dat* if not run *GerneratefirCoeff.py* in *PyScripts* folder

2. Initialize an ecg filter : 

   ```c++
   ecg_filter(int _dnn_nLayers, int *_dnn_nNeurons,const int _dnn_nInputs, int _subject, string _trial);
   ```

3. Do filter operation (receive one sample and return one sample)：

   ```c++
   double filter(double _signal, double _noise);
   ```

4. For more functions , see the head file ecg_filter.h
